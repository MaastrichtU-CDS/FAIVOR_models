Model (Docker container):  jvsoest/willemsen_tubefeed
Model URL: https://github.com/MaastrichtU-CDS/FAIVOR_models/tree/main/willemsen_PEG_tubefeed 

To pull the image: docker pull ghcr.io/maastrichtu-cds/faivor_models/willemsen_tubefeed:latest

To run the container: docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 jvsoest/willemsen_tubefeed (see https://github.com/MaastrichtU-BISS/FAIRmodels-model-package/tree/main )

To predict: curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"BMI": 19.5, "WeightLoss": -8, "TF": "1", "PS": "0", "Tumorlocation": "1", "Tclassification": "2", "Nclassification": "2", "Systherapy": "0", "RTdose_subman": 36, "RTdosesalivary": 29}'

An predicted value for this example: 0.81562756196222


The model metadata: fetched_metadata.json (the scheme from CEDAR.metadatacenter.org as it is used for fairmodels.org). 

The main sections:
	- Input data (given description for the input features)
	- General Model Information
	- Previous model tests (description of previously measured metrics and link to dataset)
	- Evaluation results (the section to publish evaluation results in the repository of fairmodels.org), has two sections: Performance metric and Dataset characteristics.

The container also includes a part of metadata with intercept and covariate weights to build the model.	
For now, we saved all metadata in the container but itâ€™s better to consider sending only fetched metadata to the container while the intercept and covariate weights should be saved with the container.

Synthetic data: data.csv
